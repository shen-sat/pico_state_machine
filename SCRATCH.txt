YOU ARE CURRENTLY THROWING VALIDATION ERROR: THIS IS FIX:
- left
-- move: once horizontal bounce anim (see below) has finished, should move 10px up and then stop
-- draw: non-looping. is based on flag on animal (so set that first):
-----if is_left is true, bounce to the left
-----if is_left is false, bounce to the right
The importamt thing here, is you will have tp change frames on anims to functions. the function will decide what the frames will be. In this case, a number will either be -ve or +ve based on the is_left flag


four directions
 initialise as green square in middle of screen

- up
-- move: should bounce (looping) -- DONE
-- draw: should flash white and red (looping) -- DONE

- down
-- move: should slowly move down pixel by pixel for 10 pixels and stop
-- draw: should alternate between circle and square and then stop (doesnt have to stop exactly when movement stops)

- right
-- move: should slowly move right pixel by pixel for 10 pixels, then bounce (looping)
-- draw: once bouncing, should be a pink color






deal card:
- card moves down
- then card moves right
- then once card reaches position: flip

select card:
- selected card plays animation

confirm card:
- card moves
- once card finishes moving, play animation (NOTE: for small movements in animation, anim can take care of)

cursor:
- only idle if all other objects are idle - but how do we know all other objects are idle (what attribute to check?)



- move_state = idle
- draw_state = idle
